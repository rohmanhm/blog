Have you've been using the new redux hooks called `useSelector` into your app?
If so, have you ever getting issue when you need to reuse the selector logic to get data from your store based parameters?

If yes, I believe we're aligned.

Let me tell you my problem is when using `useSelector` from **react-redux**.
Let say I have `selectHeavyComputation` selector that do a heavy computation in my store and this function receives `id` as the argument. A different `id` will return different result (Of course. YES).

Unfortunately if you're using `useSelector`, you can only use it once at the top of your component logic, and etc; because this is the [rules of hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html), right?

```js
const App = () => {
  const data = useSelector(selectHeavyComputation("1"));

  return <>{data}</>; // html: A
};
```

Now, the problem is how to change the parameter value so I can get a different result? I want to change from `1` to `5` and I expect the html result become `E` instead of `A`.

Below is my first try but didn't work.

```js
const App = () => {
  const getHeavyProcess = useSelector(selectHeavyComputation);

  return <>{getHeavyProcess("5")}</>; // Error!!!
};
```

And then I tried to refactor the curried selector functions but still didn't work either.

After struggling more than 1 hour, and then my final finding that works for me is to create a separate component.
What? Why I don't think of this at the first place? ðŸ˜¤

So I try to create a separate component apart from the `App` component.

```js
// HeavyCompute.js

const HeavyCompute = ({ id }) => {
  const data = useSelector(selectHeavyComputation(id));
  return <>{data}</>;
};
export default React.memo(HeavyCompute);

// App.js
const App = () => {
  return <HeavyCompute id="5" />; // html: E
};
```

Okay, now it's a happy ending ðŸ¤©
But to be honest I will prefer something like below.

```js
const App = () => {
  const getHeavyProcess = useSelector(selectHeavyComputation);
  return <>{getHeavyProcess("5")}</>; // Error!!!
};
```

Or maybe something like `reexecuteQuery` from [urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/basics/queries/#run-a-first-query) which allows me to reexecute the function inside a function or even an effect whenever I want.
So it could be something like this.

```js
const App = () => {
  const [value, selectHeavyComputation] = useSelector(selectHeavyComputation);
  return <>{selectHeavyComputation("5")}</>; // html: E
};
```

Why do I need this? Because it doesn't requires me to create a separate component to achive the samething LOL.

## Conclusion

Right now, you need to create a separate component to reuse your selector logic if you're using `useSelector`, but if you're using the `connect` from **react-redux** I think this is not an issue at all.

Thanks.
